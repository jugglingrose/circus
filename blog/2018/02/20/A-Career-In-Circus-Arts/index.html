      <p>People often ask me, “so what do you do in the circus?”. Then I tell them that I don’t work for an actual circus, but I am a circus artist.  This is when I usually get a funny look and they become even more curious.  This is generally followed up with questions such as:  “So where do you work then?”.  Well, this blog post is going to answer that.<br>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s not unusual to see professional artists who don’t work in a traditional circus or Cirque du Soleil.  There are many other work opportunities available that stretch beyond the big top and theatre circuses.  Some of these areas include the following:<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fair/Festival<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ren Fairs<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Corporate Entertainment<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Event Entertainment<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Commercials/Television<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Half Time Shows<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cruise Ships<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Casinos<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resorts<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Theme Parks<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teaching/Traveling Workshops/Retreats<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Big Top Circus/Cirque Du Soleil/other theatrical circuses<br>  &nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, I won’t sugar coat things. The fact is, performing alone as your full time work is very difficult unless you have a contract with a cruise line or large circus production. Many of the most successful circus &amp; variety performers that I know, also have some type of side project or side job for additional income and job security.  This includes things like opening their own studios, teaching workshops/private lessons regularly, making &amp; selling custom circus apparatus, making &amp; selling costumes, running their own event entertainment agency, or there are individuals (like me) who do freelance jobs such as web development.<br>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So how does one begin to approach making a career in circus arts?  Well, I can offer a few of my own tips:<br>&nbsp;<br>  A)&nbsp;Find what makes you unique, what makes you stand out, and run with it.<br>&nbsp;</p>
<p>  B)&nbsp;Really spend time developing quality material with clean transitions and good stage presence.<br>&nbsp;</p>
<p>C)&nbsp;Unless you are performing an act that is truly one of a kind, chances are you will need to be proficient in two different disciplines to get consistent work. For example: having a solid aerial act and a solid ground act.<br>&nbsp;</p>
<p>D)  Network with the community/agents/event planners/fellow artists, you won’t get far without it.<br>&nbsp;</p>
<p>  E)  Treat it as a job, because that is what it is.  Be professional, punctual, well spoken, and develop quality marketing materials. I’ve met a few individuals who randomly decided they want to be circus artists, but they treated circus as an escape from responsibility and were unprofessional.  Needless to say, they don’t usually last.<br>  &nbsp;</p>
<p>F)  If you are lucky enough to have the opportunity (not all of us are), enroll in a quality circus program that can get you in the door with jobs upon graduation.<br>&nbsp;</p>
<p>G)  Always keep growing and challenging yourself.  Address your weaknesses and never stop learning.<br>&nbsp;</p>
<p>D) Most importantly, enjoy yourself!<br>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So for those who were just curious, I hope I answered your question.  For those who are aspiring artists, hopefully I gave you some helpful insights.<br>&nbsp;</p>
